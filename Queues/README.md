## Queue Data Structure

A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

Basic Queue Operations:

- **enqueue** − add (store) an item to the queue.
- **dequeue()** − remove (access) an item from the queue.
- **peek()** − Gets the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
- **isfull()** − Checks if the queue is full.
- **isempty()** − Checks if the queue is empty.
